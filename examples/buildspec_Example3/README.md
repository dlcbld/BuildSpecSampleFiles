# buildspec_Example3

This is an example Hello World project using Java to demonstrate the precedence of exported variables over pipeline parameters and build run arguments, with the [OCI DevOps service](https://www.oracle.com/devops/devops-service/)


### Create External Connection to your Git repository 

1. Create a [DevOps Project](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/devops/using/devops_projects.htm) or use and an existing project. 
2. In your DevOps project, create an External Connection to your GitHub repository which holds your application.
   - Create a Personal Access Token (PAT): https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
   - In the OCI Console, Go to Identity & Security -> Vault and create a [Vault]( https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm) in compartment of your own choice.
   - Create a Master Key that will be used to encrypt the PATs. 
   - Select Secrets from under Resources and create a secret using PAT obtained from GitHub account.
   - Make a note of the OCID of the secret.
   - Now, go to the desired project and select External Connection from the resources.
   - Select type as GitHub and provide OCID of the secret under Personal Access Token.
   - Finally, allow Build Service (dynamic group with DevOps Resources) to use a PAT secret by writing a policy in the root compartment as: ``` Allow dynamic-group dg-with-devops-resources to manage secret-family in tenancy```

### Setup your Build Pipeline
Create a new Build Pipeline to build, test and deliver artifacts from your GitHub Repository.

### Managed Build stage
In your Build Pipeline, first add a Managed Build stage
1. The Build Spec File Path is the relative location in your repo of the build_spec.yaml . Leave the default, for this example.
2. For the Primary Code Repository follow the below steps
    - Select connection type as GitHub
    - Select the external connection you created above
    - Give the URL to the repo which contains your application.
    - Select main branch.
    
### Specify Pipeline parameter
In your Build Pipeline , click on Parameters tab, and provide pipeline parameter as below:
Name: var       Value: 19       Description: pipeline parameter
Click on + tab to add this parameter

### Specify Exported variable
In your build_spec.yaml, specify "var" under exportedVariables section and in commands set the value of this variable to 22.

### Run your Build with Build run parameter using oci-curl


#### Setup oci-curl on localhosr
To configure access for oci-curl for the first time, follow this link https://confluence.oci.oraclecorp.com/display/DLCBLD/HOWTO%3A+Setup+oci-curl+on+localhost.


#### make a createBuildRun.json file and paste the followinf contents in it (BuildRun argument as var:23)
```
    {
    "displayName": "build#1",
    "buildPipelineId": <PIPELINE_ID>,
    "commitInfo": {
    "repositoryUrl": "string",
    "repositoryBranch": "string",
    "commitHash": "string"
    },
    "buildRunArguments": {
        "items": [
        {
            "name": "var",
            "value": "23"
        }
        ]
    },
    "freeformTags": {},
    "definedTags": {}
    }
```

#### Run your pipeline using oci-curl
```oci-curl devops-beta.us-ashburn-1.oci.oc-test.com POST createBuildRun.json "/20210630/buildRuns"```



### Check the build context after build run execution gets completed
1. Go to build history
<img src="build_history.png" />
2. Copy your Build Run OCID from current Build run
3. At the end of build run execution run the following command in your terminal
   oci-curl devops-beta.us-ashburn-1.oci.oc-test.com GET "/20210630/buildRuns/<BUILD_RUN_ID>"

  , you will find that the value of var changed to 22, which means the exportedVariable overrides both pipeline and build run parameter.
